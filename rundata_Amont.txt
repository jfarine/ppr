# RUNDATA File for sampling point: Amont
#
# Created 160415
# By      JF for CV
#
# File format: 
# - comment lines must start with a '#'; as many as desired, anywhere 
# - for every range of validity, one block of n+1 lines (n=# parameters):
#   - first line of block : date range. Specified as <start> and <end>, each as  YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm  (but will be loaded in memory as *epoch*) 
#   - for each parameter, one more line with syntax "    $param_name = value " - line must start with whitespace/s !
# - as many white spaces as >=1 are allowed between fields that show a space here (i.e. not between MM and DD)
# - any parameter must be specified with its exacte variable name, equal sign, and value - all white spaces separated
# - comments can be added at the end of any time or parameter line, starting with a '#'
#
# Parameters included:
#
# 1. gap detector - will look for gaps in data by flagging intervals between points > $thres_gap    # time in minutes!!!
#    (this is about finding out when data is missing). Recommendation set it to ST+1 min (ST=sampling time)
#
    # test commentaire pas au début - avant block

# on peut aussi rajouter une ligne de commentaires avant un paramètre

# et meme avant un bloc de temps
